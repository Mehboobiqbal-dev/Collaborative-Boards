- **User**: Central entity for authentication and authorization
- **Board**: Main collaboration space owned by a user
- **BoardMember**: Junction table for board membership with roles
- **List**: Columns within boards (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- **Card**: Tasks/items within lists
- **Comment**: Discussions on cards
- **Attachment**: Files attached to cards
- **Notification**: User notifications for activities
- **RefreshToken**: JWT refresh token storage

## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/*` - Authentication operations
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/boards/*` - Board management
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/lists/*` - List management
- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/cards/*` - Card management
- `GET/POST /api/comments/*` - Comment management
- `GET/POST/DELETE /api/uploads/*` - File upload management
- `GET/PATCH /api/notifications/*` - Notification management
- `GET /api/users/*` - User management

### Socket.IO Events

- `join-board` - Join board room for real-time updates
- `leave-board` - Leave board room
- `card:create` - Create new card
- `card:update` - Update existing card
- `card:move` - Move card between lists
- `card:delete` - Delete card
- `comment:create` - Add comment to card

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- JWT access tokens (15-minute expiry)
- Refresh tokens stored hashed in database
- Automatic token refresh in frontend

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (Admin/Member/Commenter/Viewer)
- Board-level permissions
- API endpoint protection with middleware

### Data Protection
- Password hashing with Argon2
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- CORS configuration
- Security headers with Helmet

### Network Security
- HTTPS in production
- Secure cookie configuration
- File upload validation
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma

## Performance Optimizations

### Backend
- Redis caching for expensive queries
- Database connection pooling via Prisma
- Request compression
- Rate limiting
- File serving optimization

### Frontend
- React optimization with hooks
- Socket.IO for real-time updates
- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient re-rendering

### Database
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Migration-based schema changes

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless API design
- Redis for shared caching
- Database read replicas (future)
- Load balancer for multiple API instances

### Vertical Scaling
- Efficient memory usage
- Optimized database queries
- File storage on separate service
- CDN for static assets (future)

### Monitoring
- Structured logging with Pino
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring
- Health check endpoints

## Deployment Architecture

### Docker Containerization
```


### Production Considerations
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secret management
- Database backups
- Monitoring and alerting
- SSL/TLS certificates
- Reverse proxy configuration
- Log aggregation
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes)
